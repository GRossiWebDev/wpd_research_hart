<h2>White Competitive Analysis</h2>
<h3> Competitor Website: https://foragerchef.com/</h3>

<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Above the fold notification that subscribing is free, along with how to follow/subscribe buttons. Seeing the number of subscribers count adds a reassuring feeling to subscribing to the website.
  </li>
  <li>
    An image of food (its the beginning of a blog post) above the fold. This gets the users attention and declares that the website is about food.
  </li>
  <li>
    Besides background image, the website has a clean and sophisticated look to it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Background image over the whole page is distracting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Websites logo is low resolution, making one of the most important parts of the website blurry. It is also attached to the background image of the website.
  </li>
  <li>
    Confusing sub-nav wording for links (under "Meat", four-legged, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Confusing links to other pages when on a different page (Plants page, "Plant Profiles" is a link to a whole seperate page but has the appearance of a header)
  </li>
  <li>
    Instagram links on left aside are confusing, I originally thought that the images were part of a gallery and was not expecting to be sent to the Instagram page.
  </li>
</ul>

 </li>
 <li>
   She goes to the "homemade" recipe sites.
 </li>
 <li>

 </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    She does not like it when websites try to get fancy with a bunch of "foodtalk" in their recipes, she prefers it to be the recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
    She likes when the recipe includes a picture of the finished product so she can see how bad she is failing at the recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky prefers when the layout of the websites are simple. "I am here for the recipe and ingredients, I want to get an idea of what I am going to get."
  </li>
  <li>
    Depending on what is looked up, Becky likes to see alternate ingredients to the recipes. (for example, if you look at pancake batter, all the ingredients are on the box but it says you can also use water instead of buttermilk).
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky likes when the recipes in the websites offer substitutions. "You are already stressed out enough trying to find a recipe."
  </li>
  <li>
    "I am not a video person. I would rather have a step by step instruction, I am not going to watch and then skim through a whole video."
  </li>
  <li>
    Some websites have both which Becky does not mind since the video can be skipped.
  </li>

      <li>
        Yield (Servings)

      </li>
      <li>
        Prep Time
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky goes on ingredients rather than reviews when picking a recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky stated some recipes offer sides that would be good with recipes which is "pretty cool" so then she knows what goes good with the meal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky suggested a leftovers recipe section at the bottom of the recipe which would "be cool", so she knows what she can do with her remaining meal after.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>

      <h2>Frisco User Persona</h2>
      <p>Male, 21 beginner cook</p>
      <p>Experiences: When previously looking up recipes online, he has trouble understanding the directions and would like them to be more clear. He said that when they are in bulleted lists it makes them easier to read and understand. He always is on his phone when looking up recipes, so it is important for them to be responsive. When a website is organized he can find what he is looking for. Something that turns him away from websites is when they are "plain and unnappealing".</p>

      <h2>Clutter Competitive Analysis</h2>

      <p><a href="https://food52.com/">Food52</a> is a blog site for recipes, living, and travel, and tries to push the users to buy items they are selling. The website does have a Q&A area. It is called <a href="https://food52.com/hotline">Hotline</a>.</p>

      <p>The site seems lacking in colors, as white and grey are the main two colors used through the site, with little bits of gold used. The gold is used on links and buttons that are not main navigation. There is gold also on a blog's rating.</p>

      <p>It isn't lacking in pictures except in the Q&A area. The blogs and home page has pictures everywhere while the Q&A area is only the questions.</p>

      <p>The Q&A area is able to be split into urgent, unanswered, and topics. The questions can be answered by anyone. The answers are voted on by others on the site and brings the top most 'liked' comment to the top.</p>

      <p>Went to community college for finance</p>

      <p>Olivia has been baking since she was a child. She only recently started looking online for recipes as she is not very good with technology and prefers paper print outs. She just recently got an iPhone 6 and still prefers her computer over her phone.</p>

      <p>Olivia likes to print out the recipes she finds online and texts her friend when she has questions. Her friend use to run a bakery and is only good with helping with deserts. Olivia said she finds herself on FaceBook asking others for help when it comes to dinners and snacks.</p>

      <p>Olivia struggled to find a website she liked to help explain her favorite website for recipes. She brought up FaceBook when trying to explain and used it the whole time to explain.</p>

      <p>Favorite Websites</p>
      <ul>
        <li>FaceBook (For enterainment and connecting with others)</li>
        <li>Google (For questions others cannot answer)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Likes</p>

      <h2>Rossi Competitive Analysis</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/">GimmeSomeOven</a> is a culinary blog site that showcases how to tutorials, videos, and printable recipes. While the website shows videos if you click on a specific recipe, they also display videos on their YouTube account that is linked to the website.</p>

      <p>
        The website by itself has little to no color. However, the recipes bring fun and color to an otherwise black and white page. It reminds me of looking at a fancy personal cookbook.
      </p>

      <p>
        The website displays excellently on a mobile device. However, space is not utilized well on larger devices and screens. The website does not increase the size of text as the screen size gets larger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each recipe has between five and seven images that showcase what the dish is supposed to look like. This helps as some recipes people may not know. They understand this and give a brief history on a dish that potential chefs may have pushed away because they did not understand what they were actually making. An example of this can be seen here:. <a href="https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/cacio-e-pepe/">Cacio-e-pepe</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        On every recipe post, there is an option to print out the recipe or pin it on Pinterest. It also includes materials and equipment that you can buy on Amazon.
