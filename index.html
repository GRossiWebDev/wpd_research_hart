      <h2>Frisco User Persona</h2>
      <p>Male, 21 beginner cook</p>
      <p>Experiences: When previously looking up recipes online, he has trouble understanding the directions and would like them to be more clear. He said that when they are in bulleted lists it makes them easier to read and understand. He always is on his phone when looking up recipes, so it is important for them to be responsive. When a website is organized he can find what he is looking for. Something that turns him away from websites is when they are "plain and unnappealing".</p>
