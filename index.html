<h1>Hart Project Research</h1>
<h2>White Competitive Analysis</h2>
<h3> Competitor Website: https://foragerchef.com/</h3>

<h3>Strengths:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Above the fold notification that subscribing is free, along with how to follow/subscribe buttons. Seeing the number of subscribers count adds a reassuring feeling to subscribing to the website.
  </li>
  <li>
    An image of food (its the beginning of a blog post) above the fold. This gets the users attention and declares that the website is about food.
  </li>
  <li>
    Besides background image, the website has a clean and sophisticated look to it.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Weaknesses:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Background image over the whole page is distracting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Websites logo is low resolution, making one of the most important parts of the website blurry. It is also attached to the background image of the website.
  </li>
  <li>
    Confusing sub-nav wording for links (under "Meat", four-legged, etc.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Confusing links to other pages when on a different page (Plants page, "Plant Profiles" is a link to a whole seperate page but has the appearance of a header)
  </li>
  <li>
    Instagram links on left aside are confusing, I originally thought that the images were part of a gallery and was not expecting to be sent to the Instagram page.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>White User Persona</h2>
<<<<<<< HEAD
n the body of the index.html in the cloned local repo, add the fake name and demographic info of the user, and a list of the experiences and preferences under the H2 that says "yourlastname User Persona"
<h3>Name: Becky Harrington</h3>
<h3>Demographic: Female 25-35 years of age</h3>
<h3>Experiences:</h3>
<ul>
 <li>
  Becky has visited websites that have been about recipes or cooking help.
 </li>
 <li>
  When on the site she stated that she looks for ingredient quality (which depends on the item she is looking up to cook.)
 </li>
 <li>
   Does not go to specific recipes.
 </li>
 <li>
   She goes to the "homemade" recipe sites.
 </li>
 <li>
   She stated that she has been to multiple sites where the recipe was hidden under a bunch of different content or ads and this made her look to a different site.
 </li>
 <li>
   In her experiences Becky has been discouraged if a recipe appears too difficult and browsed other websites until she either found an easier recipe or a different recipe.
 </li>
 <li>
   Becky has never went online to ask a food/cooking related question.
 </li>
 <li>
   Becky has never visited a site to figure out cooking problems, albeit interested to see how it would work, she only ever visited these type of sites for recipes.
 </li>
</ul>
<h3>Preferences:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    She does not like it when websites try to get fancy with a bunch of "foodtalk" in their recipes, she prefers it to be the recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
    She likes when the recipe includes a picture of the finished product so she can see how bad she is failing at the recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky prefers when the layout of the websites are simple. "I am here for the recipe and ingredients, I want to get an idea of what I am going to get."
  </li>
  <li>
    Depending on what is looked up, Becky likes to see alternate ingredients to the recipes. (for example, if you look at pancake batter, all the ingredients are on the box but it says you can also use water instead of buttermilk).
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky likes when the recipes in the websites offer substitutions. "You are already stressed out enough trying to find a recipe."
  </li>
  <li>
    "I am not a video person. I would rather have a step by step instruction, I am not going to watch and then skim through a whole video."
  </li>
  <li>
    Some websites have both which Becky does not mind since the video can be skipped.
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky likes a summary of the recipe on top of the page. She showed a page which listed the:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Level of difficulty
      </li>
      <li>
        Yield (Servings)
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook Time
      </li>
      <li>
        Prep Time
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky goes on ingredients rather than reviews when picking a recipe.
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky stated some recipes offer sides that would be good with recipes which is "pretty cool" so then she knows what goes good with the meal.
  </li>
  <li>
    Becky suggested a leftovers recipe section at the bottom of the recipe which would "be cool", so she knows what she can do with her remaining meal after.
  </li>
</ul>
